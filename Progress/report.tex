    Over the last few years there has been a shift in type of devices connected to the internet from just servers, PC's and later smartphones, to small embedded processors that can control many devices. The idea of connecting such devices to internet has been dubbed "Internet of Things" or "IoT" and has the aim to make our lives simpler. These IoT devices can range from industrial applications, such as automated factories, to public infrastructure, like a smart electrical grid, or more homely devices in a smart connected home. Thus due to the wide range of products that a connected IoT device can be applied to improve the efficiency and/or usefulness, it has been predicted that billions of devices will be in use by \textcolor{red}{[insert year/reference]}. This also means that the complexity of the devices varies greatly with simple light switches and even kettles being given the IoT treatment \textcolor{red}{[insert reference]}, but at the other end of the scale a network of connected self-driving cars being considered \textcolor{red}{[insert reference]}.
